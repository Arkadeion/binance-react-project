# Binance React Project

This project was created as an exercise during my web development course at Develhope.

The purpose of this application is to fetch data from the public Binance APIs and compile it in two tables:

- The first one is located at the /assets page and it compiles a table with all the available assets and how many time each appears in the markets. The assets themselves can also be clicked on and they redirect you to the /markets page
- The second one is located at the /markets page and it has a fully sortable and filterable table with all the markets available.

The project uses Tailwind CSS to handle the styling of everything and react-router-dom to handle the routing in the application.
